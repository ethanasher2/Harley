            <p>Dear Harley,</p>
            <p>Thank you for being in my life and thank you for giving this life a path and structure. You have made me the happiest in this world. This month was the best month so far. Thank you so much for being in my life and let's stay best friends for our entire lives, even after life. Let's go out there and touch the skies and tell the clouds that there is a friendship more beautiful than them, or stars, or the universe. I know all of us are made of stardust, but somehow I found a dust who has the power to recreate a dead star, who can love a stone and turn it into holy water. Thank you so much for being in my life. I promise to hold your hand and walk on the path where you take me, because I'm sure the path and the destiny will be more beautiful than heaven, because it's YOU who's holding my hand.</p>
